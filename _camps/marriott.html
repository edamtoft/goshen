Leadership is provided by the camp and is a combination of trained adults and youth camp staff members whose main purpose is to ensure a safe, exciting, and fun week at camp.</p>
        <p>Scouts may attend as many weeks as they want. Participants must be registered Boy Scouts. There is no minimum age requirement.</p>
        <p>Provisional Residential Camp is available all six weeks of camp.</p>
