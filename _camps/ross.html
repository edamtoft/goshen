tagline: We give scouts a great week and introduction to Scouting.
aboutText: "Camp Ross is the second of two Webelos Camps and offers camping for 250. Our facilities include aquatics with a 23â€™ trampoline, nature area, handicraft area, archery range, BB range, and direct access to hiking trails. As of 2014, we have a new campfire circle. We also have a recently refurbished chapel where Packs can participate in the Duty to God program. Major difference from Camp PMI is our feel: Ross is much more spread out and much flatter, with a bit less tree cover. Our feel is similar to that of a Cub Day Camp. Camp Ross is great fun for Webelos and their leaders and the staff helps to provide an added level of comfort as these young men prepare to bridge into Boy Scouts."
