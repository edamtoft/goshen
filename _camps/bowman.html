aboutText: Camp Bowman offers camping for 400 and includes a chapel, handicraft area, extensive archery, rifle and shotgun areas, parade field, aquatics, shower house, and direct access to hiking trails. Camp Bowman is our Patrol Cooking Camp and can help your Scouts apply their skills whether they are brand new or in their late teens. There are lots of lessons (teamwork, cooking, cleaning, etc.) to be learned through Patrol Cooking that cannot be learned in a dining hall.
