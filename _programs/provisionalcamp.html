aboutText: "Scouts who have found that their units are not signed up for camp, cannot attend with their Troop, or Scouts who want to attend a second week are eligible to attend Camp Olmsted as a Provisional camper. The Scouts are grouped together in a Provisional Troop and have the opportunity to experience all the activities that Camp Olmsted has to offer. Leadership is provided by the camp and is a combination of trained adults and youth camp staff members whose main purpose is to ensure a safe, exciting, and fun week at camp."
